# Keyword Detection
This is a Repository for a Speech Recognition Model for Keyword Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks. The model takes raw audio as input and extracts MFCCs, which is used for classification. 

## Dataset

All the models were trained on the  [Speech Commands Dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html) by Google.
